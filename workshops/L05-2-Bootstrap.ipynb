    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap and resampling are widely applicable statistical methods which relax many of the assumptions of classical statistics. Resampling methods draw heavily on the CLT. Specifically resampling methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow computation of statistics from limited data\n",
    "- Compute statistics from multiple subsamples of dataset\n",
    "- Minimal distribution assumptions\n",
    "- Computationally intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used resampling methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomization or permutation methods (e.g., Fisher's exact test)\n",
    "- Bootstrap: resample with equivalent size and replacement\n",
    "- Jackknife: leave one out resampling\n",
    "- Cross validation: resample into folds without replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there is no magic involved. When using resampling methods always keep in mind the several pitfalls:\n",
    "- If sample is biased, the resample statistic is biased.\n",
    "- Sample variance and CIs are no better than what the sample allows.\n"

    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomization and permutation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization and permutation methods were pioneered by Fisher as early as 1911. Fisher fully developed the theory in his 1935 book. Scalability of these methods remain limited, even with modern computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation was originally proposed by Kurtz in 1948. Mosier extended the method to double cross validation in 1951. The modern method of nested or multicross-validation were introduced by Krus and Fuller in 1982. Today, cross-validation is widely used in the testing of machine learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jackknife Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Maurice Quenouille originally suggested this method in 1949. The jackknife was fully developed\n",
    "by John W. Tukey, who gave the method its name, in 1958. Tukey saw that method as a simple tool useful for many purposes like a pocket knife. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootstrap \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI410/img/Efron1980.jpg\" style=\"float: left; height: 150px; padding-left: 10px;\" title=\"Efron's 1980 book.\" />\n",
    "The bootstrap method was first suggested by Efron and Hinkley in 1978 and further developed by Efron in 1979. A full treatment was provided in Efron's 1980 book. \n",
    "\n",
    "With increased computing power, use of bootstrap methods continues to expand. Check out <a title=\"YouTube: Interview with Bradley Efron, BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2tOhMaXWvI\" target=\"newwindow\">Efron himself explaining</a> the usefulness of bootstrap method."
