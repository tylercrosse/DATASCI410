    "This notebook contains an introduction to the multidimensional visualization methods data scientists used to explore the relationships between the variables in complex data sets. Data scientists spend a lot of time working on understand the relationships within the variables in the data (**data exploration**). Visualization is a key skill for any data scientist performing these tasks. \n",

    "Inherently, computer displayed  graphics are two-dimensional. Yet, we often wish to display multi-dimensions of a data set to better understand the relationships between the variables. In this lesson we will explore some of the visualization techniques which can be applied to these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lessons are divided into several parts. In each part you will learn how to use the visualization tools available in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overview of two dimensional plot types** is a review of creating basic plot types used to construct visualizations. These plots naturally display the relationship between two variables on the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
    "- **Using Aesthetics** is an overview of how to project additional plot dimensions using plot aesthetics. Using aesthetics provides a method for projecting additional dimensions onto the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
    "- **Facetted plotting** also know as conditioned plotting or lattice plotting, introduces a powerful method for visualizing higher dimensional data. Arrays of plots of subsets of the data are arranged on the 2-d computer graphics display. "

    "You have covered a lot of ground in this lesson. You have explored many of the relationships in the auto price data set by creating multiple views to visualize these data. However, there  are still quite a few relationships you have not examined. For example, what about relationships with the weight or dimensions of the cars? What does new information do these introduce? In practice, you will always need to explore many dimensions of a data set for you to truly understand the important relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this tutorial you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applied basic bi-variate chart types to examine the relationships between pairs of variables. You used scatter plots with low alpha (transparency) values, as well as KDE and hexbin plots to overcome overplotting. \n",
    "- Used plot aesthetics to project additional dimensions onto a two dimensional plot surface, or to highlight aspects of the relationships in the data. Size is a plot aesthetic useful for numeric values or ordered categorical variables. Color and marker shape are useful for categorical variables. Keep in mind to limit the number and type of categories of categorical variables. Failure to do so will result in plots with many similar colors and marker shapes, which are difficult to understand at best. \n",
    "- Used multi-axis and faceted plots to project additional dimensions onto the two dimensional plot surface. The scatter plot matrix allows you to display relationships between multiple variables on a single set of axes. In faceted plotting subsets of values (grouped values) at displayed on an array of axes. \n",
