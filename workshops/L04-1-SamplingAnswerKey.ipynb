    "# Lesson 4 - Sampling and Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is a fundamental process in the collection of data. Sampling is important because we can almost never look at the whole population. Some key points to keep in mind about sampling are:\n",
    "- An understanding of sampling is essential to ensure that analyses performed are representative of the entire population. \n",
    "- You will use inferences on the sample to say something about the population.\n",
    "- You will need estimates of variances on the sample calculations to say something about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples of sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Sample | Population |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| A/B Testing | The users we show either web sites A or B | All possible users, past present and future|\n",
    "|World Cup Soccer | 32 teams which qualify in one season | All national teams in past, present and future years|\n",
    "|Average height of data science students | Students in UW Data Science Program | All students taking data science classes world wide|\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, that in several cases it is not only impractical, but impossible to collect data from the entire population. Hence, we must work with correctly collected samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lesson, you should be able to apply a number of commonly used sampling strategies: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bernoulli Sampling\n",
    "- Stratified Sampling\n",
    "- Cluster Sampling\n",
    "- Systematic Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bernoulli Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli sampling has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All population members have equal an chance of being part of the sample. \n",
    "- The sample sizes in Bernoulli sampling are not fixed, because each sample is considered separately. \n",
    "An example would be to randomly products in a factory to ensure quality.\n",
    "Let's look at an example. The code in the cell below creates a data frame with 200 random samples of a normal distribution, divided into 4 groups. Run this code and examine the summary of the sample. "

We can rest assured that larger samples will be more representatives of the population we are sampling. This theorem is the foundation of not only sampling theory, but modern computation methods including, simulation, bootstrap resampling, and Monte Carlo methods. If the real world did not follow this theorem much of statistics, to say nothing of science and technology, would fail badly. \n",

A more general proof was published by Poisson in 1837.\n",

    "- Used Bernoulli sampling to generate randomized samples of a population.\n",
    "- Applied stratified sampling to populations with unequal numbers of members. \n",
    "- Used cluster sampling to reduce the number of samples required for cases where data collection is expensive.\n",
