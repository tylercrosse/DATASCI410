    "In this exercise you will use visualization and summary statistical methods to explore a data set. You will be looking for interesting aspects in these data. Specifically, you will explore an energy efficiency data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains characteristics of over 750 buildings. The efficiency of the building is measured as either heating load or cooling load. Your goal is to find **three interesting relationships within the variables** which help you understand the energy efficiency of these buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is deliberately open-ended. Whenever you approach a new data set some open-ended exploration is required. Expect this exploration to be an iterative process. You may need to try several ideas before you find truly interesting relationships.\n",

    "The key points come from examining charts and summary statistics based on distribution Heating Load and Cooling Load. \n",

    "There are no categorical variables in this data set. There are two numeric variables, Orientation and Glazing Area Distribution, with only 4 and 2 discrete values. You can convert these integer values to factors and examine the effect on the distribution of Heating Load and Cooling Load."
